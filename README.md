# Charity-DB
This project contains SQL queries written to query a charity's database for key insights to help meet fundraising objectives for the following year.<br/>
Data Source:<br/>
The database was gotten from entrylevel.net and it contains two tables ‘donation data’ and ‘donors data’. When merged together, they contain 1000 records and 15 attributes. The dataset contains information of registered donors to the charity, information such as state, id, first name, last name, emails, gender, job field, donor’s state, donations, and donation frequency. Other additional information about the donors are in the ‘donors data’ dataset.
